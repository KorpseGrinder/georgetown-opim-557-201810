# "Welcome to Slack" Exercise

We're going to be using a chat platform called [Slack](https://slack.com/) throughout the semester to communicate with each other, and to share code snippets and links to helpful resources.

Let's take this time to get familiarized with the platform. This should be especially helpful if you haven't used Slack before.

## Instructions

### Joining

On or before the first day of class, the professor should have sent invitation emails to the university-issued addresses of all enrolled students. Click the link in the email to gain access to the course Slack organization. If you don't see an invitation email, or if you enrolled late, immediately email the professor to request access to the course Slack organization.

### Getting Started

After gaining access to the course Slack organization, take a moment to set up your profile and account settings. For example, you might want to update your display name and/or your profile photo. And you might consider adding a link to your GitHub and/or LinkedIn profiles, as desired.

When you get a moment later on, you are encouraged to [enable two-factor authentication](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication) to enhance the security of the course Slack organization. Also consider downloading the Slack app to your mobile device and configuring your notification preferences.

### Exploring

After configuring your profile and notification settings, consider taking the interactive guided tour or consulting this [guided tour document](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/217626358-Tour-the-Slack-app).

When you're ready, perform the following actions:

  1. Send an introductory message like "Hello Everyone!" to the `#557` channel. Optionally include a fun emoji in your message.
  2. View messages posted by other students in the `#557` channel, and [add an emoji reaction](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206870317-Emoji-reactions) to someone else's message.
  3. [Start a thread](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-threads)
  4. Send a direct message (DM) to yourself, and/or a friend, and/or `@prof-rossetti`.
  5. DM yourself a few times, using different [message formatting](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks) options, including [code snippets](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204145658-Create-a-snippet).
  6. Browse existing channels and know you can search for channels to join.
  7. When you have a free moment, to start preparing for the [Industry Insights Assignment](/assignments/industry-insights/assignment.md), consider searching meetup.com for business and/or technology events in the DC area. If you find an event that looks interesting, post a link to the `#events` channel.

And now you know how to Slack! :tada:
