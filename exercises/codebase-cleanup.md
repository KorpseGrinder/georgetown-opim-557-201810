# "Codebase Cleanup" Exercise

## Learning Objectives

  1. Find practical applications for learning new programming concepts like custom functions and sub-procedures with parameters.
  2. Learn techniques for improving system maintainability and quality control.

## Instructions

So, you've completed the ["ActiveX Controls"](/exercises/activex-controls.md) exercise, and your original solution most likely contains duplicate code terms and expressions, especially around the OptionButton and Checkbox challenges (see "Original" code examples below).

Your mission for this new exercise is to **remove as much code duplication as possible** from the original exercise solution. (see "Simplified" code examples below).

If you have an existing workbook, copy and save a new version named something like "codebase-cleanup.xlsm", so you will be free to work on this new exercise without messing up the solution to the previous exercise. Otherwise, consider beginning fresh with this [starter workbook](/exercises/codebase-cleanup/codebase-cleanup-starter.xlsm).

## Examples

  + OptionButton Solution: [Original](/exercises/codebase-cleanup/options-original.vb) --> [Simplified](/exercises/codebase-cleanup/options-simplified.vb)
  + Checkbox Solution: [Original](/exercises/codebase-cleanup/checks-original.vb) --> [Simplified](/exercises/codebase-cleanup/checks-simplified.vb) --> [Simplified Further](/exercises/codebase-cleanup/checks-simplified-further.vb) :smiley_cat:
