# "Codebase Cleanup" Exercise

## Learning Objectives

  1. Find practical applications for learning new programming concepts like custom functions with parameters.
  2. Learn techniques for improving system maintainability and quality control.

## Instructions

So, you've done the ["ActiveX Controls"](/exercises/activex-controls.md) Exercise, right? Chances are your solution contains some duplicate code, especially around the "Checkbox" challenge.

Copy your existing workbook solution and save the new version named something like "activex-cleanup.xlsm", so you will be free to work on this new exercise without messing up the solution to the previous exercise.

Your mission for this exercise is to remove as much code duplication as possible from the original exercise solution.

> HINT: you'll need to define and invoke your own custom function(s) and/or sub-procedures which pass-in parameter(s).
