# "Codebase Cleanup" Exercise

## Learning Objectives

  1. Find practical applications for learning new programming concepts like custom functions with parameters.
  2. Learn techniques for improving system maintainability and quality control.

## Instructions

So, you've done the ["ActiveX Controls"](/exercises/activex-controls.md) Exercise, right? Chances are your solution might contain some duplicate code, especially for the "OptionButton" and "Checkbox" challenges. Your mission for this exercise is to **remove as much code duplication as possible** from the original exercise solution.

> HINT: you'll need to define and invoke your own custom function(s) and/or sub-procedures which pass-in parameter(s).

If you have an existing solution workbook, copy and save a new version named something like "activex-cleanup.xlsm", so you will be free to work on this new exercise without messing up the solution to the previous exercise. Otherwise, create a new workbook and quickly set up spin buttons 1-4 and option buttons 1-4, and setup your new workbook with the example "before" code (below).
