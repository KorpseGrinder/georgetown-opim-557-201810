# "User Form Controls" Exercise

## Learning Objectives

  1. Translate your understanding of ActiveX Control interface elements into their respective User Form counterparts.

## Instructions

After completing the ["ActiveX Controls" exercise](/exercises/activex-controls.md), add another Command Button to the "Interface" sheet.

The button's caption should read "Launch My User Form", and when it is clicked, it should show a User Form.

On the User Form, add a handful of available interface elements, including a button which has its own click event and does things when clicked, like displaying a message box containing the other input values.
