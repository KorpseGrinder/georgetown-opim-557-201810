# Welcome to OPIM 557

Hello students, I hope you're enjoying your Fall Break.

Please be aware I've posted a *draft* syllabus and *tentative* calendar outline to the [course Canvas site](https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/65741). So check it out if you're curious, otherwise look out for another email from me in the coming days with instructions on how to prepare for the first class.

\- Professor Rossetti

PS - If you're interested in gaining early access to all the class videos from last semester, email me at mjr300@georgetown.edu and I'll share the links!
