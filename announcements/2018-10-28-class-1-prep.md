# Class 1 Preparations

Hello Students,

I'm looking forward to our first class on Tuesday morning. To prepare for class, please perform all of the following activities:

  1. Submit the [OPIM 557 Student Onboarding Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/gXzMBoEmKl4jqVV43)
  2. Read the [Syllabus](/SYLLABUS.pdf) and the [Troubleshooting Guide](/HELP.md)
  6. Look out for an invitation email to join the [OPIM 557 Slack organization](https://georgetown-opim-557.slack.com), and follow along with the [Onboarding Guide](/SLACK.md) after you have access.
  3. Read about [Information Systems](/notes/information-systems/README.md) and Decision Support Systems
  4. Follow along with this [VBA Getting Started Guide](/notes/visual-basic/getting-started.md)
  5. Learn about [Macros](/notes/visual-basic/macros.md) and perform the ["Hello Macro" exercise](/exercises/hello-macro.md)

During class I will ask for one or more volunteers to share their Macros. I look forward to seeing what you create.
