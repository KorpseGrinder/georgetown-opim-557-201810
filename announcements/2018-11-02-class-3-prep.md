# Class 3 Preparations

Hello Students,

Please remember to submit the [weekly progress check-in form](https://goo.gl/forms/rsRRFD9QXt5JbfUb2) before end of day today. 

To prepare for class on Tuesday, if you haven't already done so, I encourage you to spend time working through [material](/SCHEDULE.md#unit-i-building-systems-with-vba-in-ms-excel) from the first two classes, including the first two exercises ([Smart Workbooks](/exercises/smart-workbooks.md), [ActiveX Controls](/exercises/activex-controls.md)).

I also encourage you to look ahead to material for the upcoming week, and see how far you can progress through the first project ([Simple System](/projects/simple-system.md)), which is due next Friday by end of day.

As always, feel free to post questions to Slack and I will provide remote support. But if anyone would like additional in-person support, I'll be holding office hours next week on Tuesday and Wednesday - consult the calendar for more details. 

Have a great weekend, and see you next week.

 \- Professor Rossetti
