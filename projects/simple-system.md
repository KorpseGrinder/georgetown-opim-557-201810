# "Simple System" Project

> The Simple System acts as an introduction to information systems, software application development, programming with VBA in MS Excel, user interface design, and data management. Students will create an interactive GUI application which accepts user form inputs and saves corresponding records in a separate worksheet.

## Learning Objectives

  1. Create an information system which captures and stores information inputs, and displays information outputs.
  2. Practice designing user interfaces and experiences.

## Instructions

Create a new macro-enabled workbook named **`netid`-simple-system.xlsm**, where `netid` is your university-issued net identifier (i.e. the first part of your university-issued email address).

Rename the first sheet to "Prompt". Create new blank worksheets called "Instructions", "Interface", and "Data", respectively.

Further-develop your workbook to meet the project requirements below.

### Business Prompt Requirements

Think of a use case where some business or organization would want to capture information from customers or users through in-person or online submission of a form. For example: residents submitting a "Building Permit Application" at town hall, or a user submitting a post on a social media site like Facebook or Twitter, or a user placing an order on a retail site like Amazon, or a student registering for classes, etc.

Try to think of a business prompt that involves a form with a broad variety of different interface elements. Your business prompt can be real, loosely based on real-life, or entirely fictional. Have fun and be creative!


On the "Prompt" sheet, describe in English your chosen business prompt, including information about who the target end user is, why the user is submitting the form, and the value this brings to the business or organization.

### Information Input Requirements

When the user opens the workbook, they should see the user interface, either on the "Interface" sheet, or on a separate User Form displayed in-front of or instead of the "Interface" sheet.

The user interface should include multiple interface elements, including:

  + an interface element which allows the user to input free response text, like a Text Box or Input Box, Cell, etc.
  + at least one other kind of interface element which forces the user to choose between two or more specific options, like a Combo Box, Check Box, Toggle Button, etc.
  + a Command Button with a caption like "Submit", that when clicked triggers the information storage process

### Information Output Requirements

### User Experience Requirements

The program should provide **clear written and visual instructions** to help the user understand how to use the system as desired.

The program should run without error and be free of any idiosyncracies or confusing behavior.

As much as possible, the program should prevent the end user from becoming aware of, or otherwise being able to view or edit, information on the "Data" sheet.

## Submission Instructions

[Upload](https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/65741/assignments/165667) your workbook file to Canvas.

## Evaluation Methodology

Submissions will be evaluated based on ability to meet each of the component requirements (see corresponding sections above for detailed instructions):

Category | Weight
--- | ---
Business Prompt Requirements | 10%
Information Input Requirements | 25%
Information Storage Requirements | 35%
Information Output Requirements | 20%
User Experience Requirements | 10%

This rubric is tentative, and may be subject to slight adjustments during the grading process.
